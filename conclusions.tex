\textbf{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The HFCC is a challenging property to compute in terms of basis set
\item GTOs struggle, and tailor made basis sets are necessary
\item Even the highly adaptive and systematic MW basis fails out of the box
\item High numerical precision is attainable by regularizing the molecular potential
\end{itemize}
